  How to use the stack-based calculator
  1  Determine which equation you want to calculate 
  2  Enter the equation through the Main Method argument. Running the main method, the compiler will ask you to enter

c) Each pattern of equation is allocated to a separate container (there are two of them, one for the Operator, the other for the Operand). 
d) If everything went well, the answer to the equation remains in the final container. It displays
